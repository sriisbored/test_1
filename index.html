        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Our team intends to enhance the yield of the Coffea arabica coffee variety by combating one of its most significant obstacles, the plant disease, "Coffee Leaf Rust," caused by the fungi Hemileia vastatrix (HV), which targets leaves and juvenile branches causing premature defoliation, a reduction in photosynthetic capacity, and overall weakening of the coffee trees Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR).

          We have chosen Bacillus subtilis as our chassis of choice for this project due to its natural presence in the coffee plant microbiota and its proven ability to combat fungal pathogens. This natural association makes B. subtilis a more ecologically balanced option for controlling CLR, caused by HV, and reduces the risk of disturbing the natural balance of the ecosystem.</p>

      <article id="Understanding the Function of Iturin: Its Production and Mechanism of Action">
        <h2>Understanding the Function of Iturin: Its Production and Mechanism of Action</h2>
        <p>The iturin A operon is roughly 38kb long and is composed of four genes: ItuD, ItuA, ItuB, and ItuC, in the respective order that code for their respective enzymes​[8]. ituA is a hybrid of polyketide synthetase (PKS) and NRPS with an additional PCP and C-domain for NRPS​[4], while the other synthetases are non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Each NRPS is made up of modules, each of which functions as a catalytic unit that adds one amino acid to the elongating peptide chain.
          
          ituD: Malonyl coenzyme A transacylase.
          
          ituA: 449kDa PKS-NRPS enzyme.
          
          ituB: A 609kDa NRPS.
          
          ituC: A 297kDa NRPS.
          
          These synthetases possess modules—units that catalyze the incorporation of a specific amino acid into the growing peptide chain. The amino acid sequence of the peptide is usually colinear with the arrangement of the modules of NRPSs​[9]. These modules can be further subdivided into different domains characterized by sets of short, conserved sequence motifs.
          
          Adenylation domain (A): This domain recognizes the amino acid, selects it, and adenylates it at the expense of ATP to form an acyl-adenylate intermediate (aminoacyl adenylate), attaching said amino acid to the activated T domain.
          Condensation domain (C): Peptide bond formation of two consecutively bound amino acids is catalyzed by the condensation domain when two neighboring monomers are activated.
          Peptidyl carrier domain (PCP) / Thiolation domain: The adenylated amino acid covalently binds to a phosphopantetheine carrier of the adjacent PCP domain. This domain is a transport unit activated by phosphopantetheinyl transferases, which modifies the amino acid adenylate to carry the sulfhydryl group responsible for tethering the amino acid residue via a thioester bond​[10]​ and binding it to conserved serine residues in the carrier domain.
          Epimerization domain (E): Catalyzes the conversion of l-amino acids to d-isomers and is typically associated with the module that incorporates d-amino acids.
          Thioesterase domain (T): It attaches to the peptide’s conserved serine residue and then severs the connection using a nucleophile, thus initiating cyclization and the release of the product peptide.</p>
